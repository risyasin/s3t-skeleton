A Sample app with Slim3, Twig, Redbean & with a nice Admin UI 

I've been playing with PHP7 & Slim3 since beta in my spare time. Really enjoyed. This is just a dead simple CMS built on of them with a few more perks. 
I promise! I will finish it once mature enough to be used easily and I am going to add proper documentation (not only API) to install & use it.
